# imgui-knobs-svg

Use an SVG background and foreground element on top of [imgui-knobs](https://github.com/altschuler/imgui-knobs) thanks to [lunasvg](https://github.com/sammycage/lunasvg) .  
Add `imgui-knobs-svg.h` to your project as well as imgui-knobs and lunasvg, the latter needs to be built as a static library.  
See `example/` folder as well as [minisilver](https://github.com/Simon-L/minisilver) for a real life usage.

Depends on imgui, imgui-knobs and lunasvg.
